      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Steven Rejdukowski. Im a former E-Commerce Manager looking to make a change for myself in the tech field. Software engineering was an interest of mine for a long time but I wanted to make it my next career. I have always had an affinity for computers and solving problems so it seemed like this was a perfect meld for both of those interests of mine. The fast-paced and ever-changing tech industry seemed like a great fit for me because I love immersing myself in my craft, whatever it may be. In this industry, you can never know too much. My background in creating an E-Commerce presence from the ground up will help me understand the products I am working with and consider the consumer when working on products and applications. I look forward to learning and putting into code all that I have learned and experienced to help be a vital part of a software engineering team!",
